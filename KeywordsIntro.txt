What is Version Control?
Version Control is basically a list of changes made in a particular file at a particular time. 
In Laymen Terms, we can say it is a checkpoint where your previous data is saved and you can continue working further whenever you want.

How to create a repository?
Steps :- 
Create your github account -> Open repositories and then click New Button in top right corner -> Then you'll be redirected to a page asking for Name and description of your Repo and fill the same
This way your repository is created.

#Note : Commit is retracable and we can revert the changes using the hash code given for a particular commit.
#Note : When we create a file in github and enter some data first time while creating it, then that is known as initial commit.
#Note : Afterwards all other changes are referred as Commits #num (num = 1,2,3,...)


Now what is Branch?
Branch is basically a way for social coding.
When the changes are made by the reporsitory owner so, he/she does it in main branch itself and if they want to divide the main branch separately then we create new branch.
For example : I made a list of ares in my house -
Drawing Room -> Kitchen -> Bathroom -> Bedroom -> Living Room -> Dining Room
Now my friend wants to make the list of areas of her house as well and she has same rooms + some add on areas which she want to mention so, she can simply make a new branch and commit in it -
Drawing Room -> Kitchen -> Bathroom -> Bedroom -> Living Room -> Dining Room -> Corridor -> Play Room -> Balcony -> Garden Area
So, that's how Branching works.
